## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

The hideDot team appreciates your help in keeping our project secure. We aim to make the reporting process simple and straightforward.

### How to Report

You can report security vulnerabilities by:

1. Opening a GitHub issue with the label `security`
2. Providing a clear description of the vulnerability
3. Including steps to reproduce the issue if possible

## Response Process

When a security issue is reported:

1. The maintainers will review and respond to your issue
2. We'll work on developing and testing a fix
3. A new release addressing the vulnerability will be published

## Security Best Practices

When using hideDot, consider these recommendations:

- Always review your `hidedot.conf.yaml` file content
- Be cautious with the `shell` section as it executes commands
- Use the `--dry-run` flag to preview changes before applying them

Thank you for helping make hideDot more secure!
